        <p>Over the past few years, our life has consisted of committing ourselves to the same task over and over, out of necessity to realize our aspirations. This felt like a never-ending cycle, testing our patience, and requiring us to renew our resolve repeatedly in the face of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on this period, we recognize how the depth and rigor of this time characterized by repetition has deeply grounded us in our existence, fostering within us a concrete sense of self that no other experience could instill.</p>
        <p>Our performance captures this journey, serving as a bridge to the future we are now ready to embrace.</p>
        <br>

        <p>“Repetition is reality, and it is the seriousness of life. He who wills repetition is matured in seriousness.” (Soren Kierkegaard)</p>

        <p>I have received over 20 years of classical piano training, which has included participating in competitions and providing accompaniment for choirs, especially as a teenager. Since 2015, I have expanded my musical pursuits to include playing guitar and fostering collaborations through music.</p>

        <p>My immersion in a vast repertoire of classical music until now—whether it be Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Ravel, or Bartok—has been a wellspring of inspiration for everyday experiences and creative endeavors.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am exploring ways to integrate this passion into my future work. During this public music session, I will perform on guitar, piano, and vocals. We plan to deliver an approximately 30-minute performance featuring various song arrangements. The included demo exemplifies our approach of blending songs from diverse cultural contexts in a manner authentic to our artistic aspirations.</p>
        <p>I organized this event and its concept in collaboration with my friend Kai, who specializes in philosophy. We have been collaborating for more than six years and are now transitioning as we embark on new journeys. We've drawn inspiration from the concept of Repetition, as developed by the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. We interpret Repetition as a means of deepening engagement with our pursuits, which reflects what music means to me personally.</p>
