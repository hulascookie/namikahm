        <p class="monospace">Final Showcase for the Student Collective Keio Fashion Creator, Fashion Design at ESMOD Japon</p><br>
        <p>During the dressmaking process for the fashion show "Impression," I delved into the intricate relationships between fabrics, focusing on the effects of layering. Layered cotton and tulle fabrics interact with light, responding to movements and introducing a rhythmic quality to the overall appearance.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>I developed the design process of dresses from conception through to the final showcase at 2019 Keio Fashion Show at Jiyū Gakuen Myōnichikan, Japan's national cultural property, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>I drew inspiration from everyday objects that initially appear simple but reveal intricate details upon closer inspection or evoke changing impressions over time. This could be the interplay of light and shadow on an object or the nuanced communication of different physical movements that have the capacity to alter verbal expression.</p>

        <p>The Keio Fashion Creator is a student-led fashion community in Tokyo that hosts an annual fashion show and regularly collaborates with artists and creative enterprises for fashion shoots and events. Consisting of four teams—Creative Direction, Designers, Press, and Model Management—it unites students from various universities in Tokyo, including technical and art institutions. I participated in organizing the Keio Fashion Creator 2019 Show while undertaking an intensive one-year fashion design course at ESMOD Japon, a fashion college partnered with Keio Fashion Creator.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>I started by experimenting with silhouettes using cotton muslin. After several fittings with models, I finalized the silhouettes and added more details using cotton and tulle fabrics, based on the pattern I developed.</p>

        <p>It was indeed the first time to make clothes for a public show. Therefore, I sought different opportunities for practice. One of those opportunities was R Project, where I worked in a team with four other students, and collaborated with the luxury second-hand label RAGTAG. We visited their warehouse and picked up unsellable clothes for upcycling.</p>

        <p>I made three pieces, including a jacket, dress, and top and, we exhibited these original pieces at a five-day pop-up event at RATGAG Shibuya boutique.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>Through the patternmaking and fashion design course, I also made a dress that used similar gathering techniques to the dress for the show. In other words, I made four pieces in total alongside the cotton and tulle layering dress for the show.</p>

        <p>This was an eight-month-long project that allowed me to have creative freedom with commitment and dedication, which I enjoyed. Alongside intensive courses at university as a freshman, I took part in courses for fashion design and patternmaking every Saturday at ESMOD Japon. </p><br><br>

        <p>I was willing to continue similar projects, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to stop the on-site activities, and I chose to pursue my academic interests by studying abroad in Belgium.</p>
