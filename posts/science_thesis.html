          <p><i>Description:</i></p>
          <p>I investigated the financial impact of sustainability reporting by analyzing the abnormal returns of stock prices around the releases of sustainability reports issued by private companies, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p><i><strong>Why is greenwashing so widespread? Why is the systematic rejection of the climate crisis so significant? Does the financial market react to new information related to environmental sustainability?</strong></i></p><br><br>
       <p>Having gained insights in international finance and data analysis prior to this research, I was aware of the possibility that there would not be any reactions towards new information on sustainability in the financial market due to the topic's possible distance from companies' principal business practices. The purpose of the research, as a student from a cross-disciplinary field, is to examine lax environmental regulations and initiatives and challenge the financial system by highlighting its structural inattentiveness to track and measure enterprises' environmental impacts quantitatively. The thesis has been recognized with a "Certificate of Excellence in Research" by the faculty at the final panel discussion session.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><i>What did I do?</i></p>
       <p>To find answers to these and related questions, I studied in detail the academic literature at the intersection of international finance, macroeconomics, business, public policy, and data science. I then conducted my own research and analyzed statistical results to build upon previous work. </p>
       <br><p><i>How did I realize the research?</i></p>
        <p>I collected, cleaned, and analyzed daily stock price data of chosen companies by Bloomberg Terminal. This research uses time series data on the daily stock prices of five publicly traded companies in the energy and luxury goods industry (n) listed either on NYA, CAC40, or Swiss Market, yielding 310 (N=n*T) observations. I employed the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) for the theoretical framework and Capital Asset Pricing Model within the empirical methodology, implementing the Event Study technique. </p>
        <p> The results of the statistical analysis indicated the weak correlation between the release of sustainability reports and stock price fluctuations. One significant reason for this result, as suggested by prior research, can be that the disclosure of sustainability reports has become a common practice among publicly traded companies. </p>
        <br><p><i>Is technology the solution?</i></p>
        <p>The considerable challenge is greenwashing, wherein companies claim, with misleading information, that they are more environmentally responsible than they actually are. Although there are various ESG-related evaluations on companies by financial data vendors, including Refinitiv, Bloomberg, LSEG, aiming to establish shared quantitative measures, their evaluation metrics and methodologies are not public, therefore, ambiguous. Some organizations aim to build an AI-powered model to track greenwashing using text-based information, but is it the solution when there is not even a fixed meaning to be 'sustainable'?</p>
        <br><p><i>Why is this important?</i></p>
        <p>This information is important to measure the impact of sustainability reporting in today‘s information environment and bridge between the urgent needs of sustainability actions and competitiveness, profitability pursued in the private sector. To learn more about the method and findings of my research, read the abstract below or check out the whole thesis:</p>

        <p><i>Abstract:</i></p>
        <p class="monospace_body">Climate change is an urgent issue across all sectors, particularly impacting private companies reliant on the extraction and constant consumption of natural resources, such as the energy and fashion industries. Publicly listed companies often publish sustainability reports to disclose non-financial performance and enhance their social image. However, terms like sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) performance carry varied meanings across contexts due to a lack of shared definitions, and the actual results of sustainability efforts are often overlooked. Legislative efforts in recent years aim to set standards for private companies' environmental responsibility and classify financial products based on environmental sustainability commitments. Nevertheless, factors like commercial success and CEOs' fiduciary duty can hinder environmentally sound decision-making in business operations. What if sustainability reports do yield short-term financial benefits? What if abnormal stock market returns occur around the release of sustainability reports? Would this incentivize companies to improve the quality of their reports and measure their environmental responsibility quantitatively,  more critically and scientifically? This research analyzes stock market returns before and after the publication of sustainability reports by three energy companies and two luxury goods companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext Paris, or the Swiss Stock Exchange. The findings indicate insufficient statistically significant correlations between report publication and stock market reaction to fully validate the hypothesis. Possible explanations include investors' focus on short-term returns and the prevalence of sustainability reports among listed companies, reducing the impact of report disclosure on investors. Future research will explore these assumptions to validate the findings.
