        <p class="monospace">Final Showcase for the Student Collective Keio Fashion Creator, Fashion Design at ESMOD Japon</p><br>
        <p>During the dressmaking process for the fashion show "Impression," I delved into the intricate relationships between fabrics, focusing on the effects of layering. Layered cotton and tulle fabrics interact with light, responding to movements and introducing a rhythmic quality to the overall appearance.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <p>I developed the design process of dresses from conception through to the final showcase at 2019 Keio Fashion Show at Jiyū Gakuen Myōnichikan, Japan's national cultural property, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>I drew inspiration from everyday objects that initially appear simple but reveal details upon closer inspection or evoke changing impressions over time. This could be the interplay of light and shadow on an object or the nuanced communication of different physical movements that have the capacity to alter verbal expression.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The Keio Fashion Creator is a student-led fashion community in Tokyo that hosts an annual fashion show and regularly collaborates with artists and creative enterprises for fashion shoots and events. Consisting of four teams—Creative Direction, Designers, Press, and Model Management—it unites students from various universities in Tokyo, including technical and art institutions.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>I belonged to the design team and participated in an intensive fashion design and patternmaking course every Saturday at ESMOD Japon, a fashion college partnered with Keio Fashion Creator.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>During the patternmaking phase, I created separate patterns for a red inner dress and an outer dress crafted from white tulle. I paid careful attention to achieving an ideal balance in the length and silhouette, as well as developing the gathering techniques for the outer dress.</p>
        <br><br>

        </div><br><br>
          
        <p>To further refine the designs, I created numerous prototypes using cotton muslin and engaged in discussions with my teachers and fellows during fittings with models.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        </div><br><br>
        <p>After that, I finalized the silhouettes and added more details using the actual cotton and tulle fabrics, based on the pattern I previously developed.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>It was indeed the first time to make clothes for a public show. Therefore, I sought different opportunities for practice. One of those opportunities was R Project, where I worked in a team with four other students, and collaborated with the luxury second-hand label RAGTAG. We visited their warehouse and picked up unsellable clothes for upcycling.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>I made three pieces, including a jacket, dress, and top and, we exhibited these original pieces at a five-day pop-up event at RATGAG Shibuya boutique.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Through the patternmaking and fashion design course, I made another dress that used similar gathering techniques. In other words, I made four pieces in total alongside the dress for the show.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>The final showcase took place in December 2019 and attracted an audience of more than 500 people in a single day.</p>

        <p>This was an eight-month-long project that allowed me to have creative freedom with commitment and dedication, which I enjoyed. I was willing to continue similar projects, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to stop the on-site activities. I chose to pursue my academic endeavor by studying abroad in Belgium.</p><br><br>
          
        <br><br><br>

        <p>Another aspect of this project involves exploring my interests in fashion design and the fashion industry. While I am fascinated by the concept of "wearing an idea," I am less interested in creating "new" products or promoting consumption. Confronting the contradiction of admiring beautiful design and fashion as primarily a business has deepened my interest in understanding global society at both local and international levels and looking into where I can make a meaningful contribution.</p>
