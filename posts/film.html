<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 50px;">
  The main purpose of this essay is to analyze the film Beautiful Boy (2018) through the lenz of deconstruction by the Algerian-born French philosopher Jacque Derrida (1930-2004). In doing so, it clarifies that the film itself challenges the binary opposition of the sober and the addicted by exploring the intimate father-son relationship of the main characters.

<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 50px; ">DECONSTRUCTION—JAQUES DERRIDA</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">
  The concept of deconstruction developed by Derrida is nearly impossible to define. Derrida states, “I often describe deconstruction as something which happens. It is not purely linguistic, involving a text or books. You can deconstruct gestures, choreography. That’s why I enlarged the concept of the text” (Smith, 1998)*. If deconstruction is a process or a practice to reproduce rather than a clear concept to remember and read it out loud, it would be more effective to focus on how to “deconstruct” and demonstrate it.

<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 50px; ">FILM ANALYSIS</p>
   <p style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 10px;">
    The film Beautiful Boy was released in 2018 and directed by Felix van Groeningen. The film plot is based on the real story, and there are interview articles on David and Nic Sheff, the main characters, as well as books written by both. 
    The characteristics of this film lie in the story’s authenticity and how it portrays, without hesitation, blame and embarrassment, fear of repeating relapse of drug overdose and the reality that neither the addicted nor the people around the person are ready to handle the consequent situation and their reactions to it (Lee, 2018)**.
</p>
       
<p style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  It was too late to stop the addiction of the son Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet) when the dad David Sheff (Steve Carell) found out that his 18-year-old son had been experimenting with all kinds of psychoactive drugs available. The binary opposition particularly observed in this film is one between the sober and the addicted. The film portrays this binary opposition by repeating Nic’s sober and addicted conditions in a time-jumping manner. It also depicts the close relationship between the father, David and the son Nic by including scenes when Nic was a healthy and happy child, and later an intelligent teenager. In most scenes where Nic is sober, such as at 00:27:13, they illustrate Nic’s normal lives without addiction and his caring and seemingly both culturally and economically rich family. Such scenes have the values of calmness or normality in which the father-son relationship goes back to the original state of Nic’s childhood. In other words, as so in reality, the sober is normal, and the addicted is abnormal in the film, and sobriety is something to “get back” when someone is ill in drug addiction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  From the deconstruction point of view, the scenes at 00:35:35, 00:56:42, and 01:46:51 are examples of the attempts to privilege the traditionally underprivileged temporarily. 00:35:35 is where Nic and his father fight since Nick stole money from his brother to purchase additional drugs. Nic draws David, who is sober, to his vulnerability and confesses that he has reached the limit and feels tired. David can no longer feel angry or disappointed for this change from Nic’s beautiful childhood to the drug addict in front of him. David Sheff, in an interview, states that he could not accept the reality of his son’s drug addiction and felt a solid resentment for it (McGrath, 2008)***. By trying hard to understand the situation, he became “addicted to his son’s addiction, unable to stop torturing himself. What had he done wrong?” (McGrath, 2008). David gradually grew his understanding by shifting his thoughts from “how could he do this to the family, me and myself to understanding that he was troubled and ill” (Itzkof, 2018)****. After doing so, he started to be able to “look at him with compassion and sadness instead of judgment and horror” (Itzkof, 2018).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  Not only how the film emphasizes the repeated failure of the son’s efforts to get out of drug addiction, the whole theme of this film, in contrast to the ordinary yet problematic media representation of drug consumption, is the act of deconstruction. In other words, by watching this film, many people almost experience what it is like to be addicted to methamphetamine or at least to have someone addicted to it close to oneself, and they may better understand how much the addiction influences their lives and the boundaries between the addicted and the sober are more obscure than they have expected.
