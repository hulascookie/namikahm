        <p>Uni-Share is a student-led community dedicated to curating ad-free "take-free" magazines, distributed at various bookstores throughout Tokyo. For Uni-Share Vol. 19, we featured artists such as Kotoha Yokozawa, Nagaho Yamamoto, Dan Isomura, Ken Kagami, Mahiru Koda, and the fashion label HOUGA.

          <p><i>What did I do?</i></p>
          <p>I especially co-led the project "The Initial Impulse.” Although I was involved in the entire process of realizing this project, my role centered around concept development, facilitating communication with artists, writing the interview article, and proofreading.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on my involvement in Uni-Share Vol. 19, I recognize this experience as the true beginning of my passion for independent magazines. At the time, I was navigating new territory with software tools and professional communication. It was clear that without the support of my team, this project wouldn't have come to fruition. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>The project spanned approximately five months, factoring in our varied university schedules that allowed for monthly meetings and ongoing online communication, which were essential for effective collaboration and progress. I learned the importance of clear communication and the power of collective effort in realizing creative endeavors.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In exploring the concept behind "The Initial Impulse," the shoot embodies an intuitive approach to confronting the unknown. At just 18 years old, through her journey as a jazz musician, Mahiru delved into the jazz scene in Boston, engaging in sessions with peers and mentors alike. Reflecting on her musical evolution, she highlights how her tastes matured over time, shaped by both personal experiences and formal education. For instance, Mahiru explained that jazz, often perceived as spontaneous and intuitive, actually involves a sophisticated form of communication during sessions—an interplay of intuition and meticulous preparation. We also interviewed her on her thoughts regarding the relationship between music and fashion and how these two fields inspire each other within her. Her courage to follow "The Initial Impulse" has shaped her original style up until now.</p>
        <p>I present this project because I am passionate about print and interested in working on independent publications in the future. I believe it is a sharp way to represent collective work and the ideas behind it.</p>
